<h1> Skiing <h1>

<p>
	Another one of my favorite things to do is to go skiing. I usually ski at either 
	Sunday River or Sugarloaf. I would say that even though I go to Sunday River more 
	Sugarloaf is my favorite mountain. I started skiing when I was 5 years old and I 
	have been doing it ever since. The first mountain that I ever skied was Cranmore
	Mountain in New Hampshire.
