<h1> Golf <h1>


<p>
	I started playing golf in 8th grade and at the time I was playing football. Then in
	the summer going into highschool I decided to play golf instead of football 
	because who wants to waste half their summer doing workouts for football. I 
	honestly started playing golf because I was lazy and didn't want to do the work 
	for football but I fell in love with the sport and it's now my favorite. I played 
	junior-varsity golf my freshman and sophomore year. Then varsity golf my junior and
	senior year. I also have gotten a hole in 1 in golf which some people will never do 
	in their life. Then there is my biggest golf achievement ever, when I was a junior 
	our golf team won the state championship for golf which was awesome to get during my
	four years playing.
